"""Core scheduler

The basic object for a class is a Runnable. All classes used for tasks
must be subclasses of Runnable. Runnable's store the tasks' repeat
interval and any subtasks it depends on.

The Scheduler class handles running the Runnables.

Scheduling works as follows:
    1. During startup all top level tasks are added to the scheduler
       via schobj.register()
    2. After all initialization is finished schobj.start() is called.
    3. Before start() starts scheduling stuff it runs _create_groups()
       to group all top level tasks which have any subtasks in common.
       This ensures that tests that need to run the same queries are
       run at the same time.
    4. All top level objects are started in a random interval between
       now and their repeat interval to distribute things.
    5. Each time a top level task finishes it will reschedule itself.

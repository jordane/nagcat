Installing Railroad
===================

Requirements
------------

Recommended:
- Python 2.6
- simplejson
- Django 1.1.x
- Nagcat
- Apache 2
- mod_wsgi

Installation
------------

Copy the entire railroad directory structure to the location of your choice,
the default configuration assumes you wish to install in
/var/lib/nagcat/railroad.

Configuration
-------------

The following configuration changes must be made:

- Edit the Apache mod_wsgi configuration files railroad/sample/django.wsgi and
  railroad/sample/railroad.conf, set the correct paths.
- Add the conf file to your Apache conf.d configuration directory (a symlink
  is recommended).
- Reload the Apache daemon
- Edit the example Django configuration file railroad/sample/settings.py to
  reflect the correct templates directory. You may optionally change the
  timezone, language, and other Django settings as you prefer.
- Copy railroad/sample/settings.py to railroad/railroad/settings.py.
- Edit the example path settings file railroad/sample/pathsettings.py to
  reflect the correct path to the nagcat data directory.
- Copy railroad/sample/pathsettings.py to railroad/railroad/pathsettings.py
- Browse to http://<hostname>/railroad, which should now display the Railroad
  welcome message as well as the list of currently configured hosts in Nagios.

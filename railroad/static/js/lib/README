The files in "./pieces/" are combined and sent to a javascript minimizer to
make "combined.min.js". The order is defined by the name of the files, and is
significant.

In general the order should be jquery, jquery ui, jquery libraries, other
stuff. In particular it is important that a librarie's dependencies come before
it by name.

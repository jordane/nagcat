        Railroad :: Upgrades
    ____________________________

This document covers two elements: upgrading your Railroad install, and
upgrading libraries which Railroad requires.

Upgrading Railroad:

    Railroad is largely a drop in upgrade, copy the new files over and restart
    Apache to cause it to reload the Railroad files. However if there is a DB
    schema change you must also update the DB schema accordingly. To do this
    use manage.py, located at /railroad/manage.py. Type the following command:

         $ manage.py syncdb

    This will sync the database schema and allow Railroad to continue
    operation.

Upgrading Railroad libraries:

    Railroad contains a number of libraries which normally are not upgraded by
    OS distribution package management. The following software is included
    with Railroad and can be upgraded if you require bug fixes or new
    features:

	/static/flot/jquery.flot.*
            Flot graphing library with the following plugins: selection, stack
            http://code.google.com/p/flot/

        /static/flot/excanvas.min.js
            explorercanvas
            http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/

        /static/jquery.min.js
            jQuery library
            http://jquery.com

        /static/jquery.form.js
            jQuery Form Plugin
            http://jquery.malsup.com/form/

    Other software libraries (Django, python-json, etc) are sourced via your
    system paths and can be upgraded using your distribution's package
    manager.
